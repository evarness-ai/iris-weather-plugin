#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Local stand-in for .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# Hosted CI cannot run for this repository (GitHub billing; we are not using GitHub CI),
# so this script IS the gate. It runs the same steps as ci.yml, in the same order:
#
#   1. install   throwaway venv -> iris-harness WHEEL -> pip install -e ".[test]" ruff black
#   2. lint      ruff check . ; black --check .
#   3. stable    iris_harness.testing.check_stable_imports([src, tests])
#   4. tests     python -m pytest -q   (no network: HTTP is MockTransport, model is scripted)
#
# Usage:   scripts/ci_local.sh
#
# Environment (all optional):
#   IRIS_HARNESS_CLONE  path to an iris-harness clone to build the wheel from.
#                       Default: ../iris-harness next to this repository.
#   IRIS_WHEEL_DIR      directory holding a prebuilt iris_harness-*.whl, used when the
#                       clone is absent (or IRIS_USE_WHEEL=1). Default: ../wheelhouse.
#   IRIS_USE_WHEEL=1    skip the build and install the newest wheel in IRIS_WHEEL_DIR.
#   PYTHON              interpreter for the venv. Default: python3.12.
#
# WHERE THIS IS NOT THE HOSTED CI, honestly:
#   1. ci.yml clones the public iris-harness at IRIS_HARNESS_REF (main) from GitHub; this
#      script builds from your LOCAL clone's working tree (whatever branch/edits it has) or
#      from a prebuilt wheel. Check the clone is at the ref you mean to test against.
#   2. ci.yml ran on ubuntu-latest with a fresh checkout; this runs on your machine, in
#      your working tree (untracked files are linted and tested too).
#   3. ci.yml's pip resolves the latest ruff/black/pip at run time and so does this; there
#      is no lock file in either, so a tool release can change the result in both.
#   4. "No network" is enforced by the harness test fixtures (it refuses sockets), the same
#      as in ci.yml; this script adds no extra network sandbox.
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS /bin/bash).
